A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. This project provides a basic command-line interface for two players to play the game.

## Features

- **Player Initialization:** The game allows two players to initialize their symbols (X or 0).

- **Symbol Selection:** Player 1 chooses between 'X' and '0', and Player 2 receives the remaining symbol.

- **Game Loop:** Players take turns to make moves on the 3x3 game board until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.

- **Winning Patterns:** The game checks for winning patterns and announces the winner when one is detected.

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python tic_tac_toe.py`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input symbols and make moves.
3. The game announces the winner or declares a draw.

## Code Structure

- `player.py`: Defines the Player class.
- `patterns_positions.py`: Contains winning patterns.
- `tic_tac_toe.py`: Main script implementing the game logic.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Play

1. Choose a symbol for Player 1 (X or 0).
2. Make moves by entering row and column numbers.
3. Win by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of your symbol.
